How would you adjust your testing strategy for a major feature release vs. a small bug fix?
In a major feature release, I would employ comprehensive, detailed test plan and realize an extensive testings like regression, exploratory testing or performance testing.

If a developer says, “This bug only happens on an older branch,” how would you handle it?
I would check if the older branch affects the last release. If it affects it, I would document the issue to assess the impact, in turn, development team should fix it.

Why is it important for testers to know which version of the app they are testing?
To accurately reproduce bugs, verify fixes, prevent regressions or align the fixes with the release.
