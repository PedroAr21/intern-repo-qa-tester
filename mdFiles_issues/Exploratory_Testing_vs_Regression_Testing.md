Why is exploratory testing particularly useful for an app like Focus Bear?
It useful because the tester could imitate a user to make an unexpected flaw in the app usability or even leveranging human intuition to expose bugs.

What risks come with relying too much on exploratory testing vs. only doing regression testing?
Exploratory testing could result in inconsistent coverage and missed regressions. On the other land, regression testing could overlook new bugs.

How would you document and report issues found during an exploratory testing session?
taking notes during session, adding screenshots, creating an issue on GitHub, using tamplates or giving a summary.
