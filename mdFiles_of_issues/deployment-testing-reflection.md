If a release goes live and users immediately report issues, what should QA do?
QA should thoroughly test the exact issue to analyze if the release should rollback or just address the issue with releasing a hotfix.

Whatâ€™s the best way to prioritize testing when working under time pressure for a hotfix?
Having a release-based report to find the issue promptly, also, collaborating with the development team to focus on last changes and reduce the impact if it is a critical problem.

How can QA help ensure stability in production while still allowing fast bug fixes?
Monitoring logs, performing regression testing, and doing automate testings.
