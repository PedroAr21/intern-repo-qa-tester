What key information should you include when submitting a screen recording of a bug?
relevant environment details and annotations highlighting the issue.

How can you ensure sensitive information is not accidentally shared in a recording?
Before recording, close sensitive tabs and applications. During recording, avoid entering personal data. Use masking tools in editing to hide confidential information.

If a bug only happens during fast interactions, how would you record and describe it effectively?
Add a slow-motion recording if I can capture it, annotate key moments, and provide precise timing.
