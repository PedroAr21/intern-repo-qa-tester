If a customer reports a crash but you canâ€™t reproduce it, what are your next steps?
I would keep a communication with the customer and I would make a report with customer's details, I would work with the development team to monitor the logs and see what happen, also, I would try to set the same environment like the customer to reproduce the bug.

When should you ask developers to add more logging, and what kind of logs would help?
When is an intermittent bug or when exist logs lack detail.

What are some common patterns in bugs that only occur for some users but not others?
When there is an speific OS that has the bug, or when a specific environment affects the user.
