If multiple features are ready for testing at the same time, how would you prioritize them?
Breaking down them in risk priority or even doing parallel testings.

How can early involvement of QA prevent last-minute testing rushes?
Prioritizing shift-left testings and test cases, implementing Cotinuous Integration(CI), collaborating early and even doing parallel testings.

What would you suggest to a team if QA keeps blocking releases due to late testing?
They should collaborate together and understand a little bit about codebase or testing to help themselves.
