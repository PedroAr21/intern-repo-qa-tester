What edge cases could break Focus Bearâ€™s onboarding flow?
Network interruptions, invalid inputs, device permmisions, resouce limits or even accessibilty settings.

If the app fails midway through a critical action, how should it behave?
It should save partial progress, prevent further damage or even rollback if possible.

How would you test for network instability and ensure Focus Bear handles it gracefully?
Simulating instability, doing unexpected changings during the instability or verifying if data was saved locally and were synchronized on the reconnection.
