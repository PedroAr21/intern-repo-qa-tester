What unique bugs could occur on Android vs. iOS, or Windows vs. macOS?
Android: Device models, it has many manufactures.
iOS: Strict environment can limit the functionality.
Windows: Driver and registry complexities.
masOS: Different UI and strict ecosystem entegraton.

If a bug is reported only on an older OS version, how would you approach testing it?
I would assess the impact, if users are likely to be affected by the bug, also, communicate with development team to address the bug and a posible backporting.

What strategies can you use if you donâ€™t have direct access to a specific device for testing?
Using device emulators, remoting device labs, partnering with device owner or asking for detailed bug reports.
