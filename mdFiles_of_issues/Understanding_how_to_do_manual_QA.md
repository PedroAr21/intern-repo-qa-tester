Why is context important in testing, and how might testing Focus Bear differ from testing another app?
Context shapes effective testing. Focus Bear, a productivity app, demands usability and user-flow testing, unlike a game requiring performance and graphics focus.

How can manual testing be both structured and adaptable at the same time?
A structure provides us a framework, while adaptibility addresses unexpected issues.

How would you approach testing a new feature in Focus Bear without a predefined test script?
Begining with exploratory testing, exploring the new feature, focusing on edge cases and usability based on the user experience.

How do you decide what to test when no detailed requirements are provided?
Focusing on user needs, risks or common funcionality to address a test.
