How would you report a bug that only happens occasionally?
Reporting the essential testings and adding a summary of how it happens in a certain time describing the steps. Also, giving environment details showing logs and recordings.

If a developer marks a bug as "Not reproducible", whatâ€™s your next step?
Collaborate with developers to verify the bug, providing a report as detailed as possible, checking different conditions and even monitoring it if is needed.

What tools or techniques can help capture extra details for unpredictable bugs?
Tools like DevTools, Wiresharck, Selinum, Visual Studio Debugger, etc.
