If you had only 15 minutes to test a new Focus Bear feature, how would heuristics help you decide what to test first?
It would help me to prioritize core funcionalities, Check boundary conditions, employ quick checks or even use the rule of three.

How can heuristics help you find edge cases and unexpected bugs?
Focusing on potencial failure points like an user input or usability.

What risks come with using gut instinct vs. structured test cases?
Gut could overlook some bugs, but using a structured test case and gut instinct is better to find all errors.
