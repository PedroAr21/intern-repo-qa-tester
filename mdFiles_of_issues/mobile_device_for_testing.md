What issues might only appear on a real device but not on an emulator?
Touch sensitivity, hardware-specific bugs, network variability, performance under load, interruptions. Emulators may not accurately replicate these conditions.

How would you report a bug that only happens on a specific device model?
Outline device model, OS version, app version, screenshots, log files. Specify the bug's occurrence on that specific model.

If an app crashes on a physical device, what steps would you take to gather useful debugging information?
Device logs or crash reports.
