How would you test Focus Bearâ€™s performance on an older device or a slow internet connection?
I would obtain an older device and I would monitor the resources, do stress testings, limit the connection and check offline behavior.

If a user reports that the app feels slow, what steps would you take to investigate?
I would communicate with the user to gather information, I would reproduce the issue, set the same environment, analyze logs or collaborate with developers.

What performance optimizations could help Focus Bear run smoothly on low-end devices?
Reducing memory management, optimizing animations and simplifying the UI elements or even using efficient data transfer protocols.
