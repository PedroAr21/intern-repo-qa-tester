How would you report a UI glitch vs. a critical login failure differently?
I would clasify them by the impact, If the UI glitch is a minor impact, it could be address later, but a critical login failture is part of high bug severity, It must be fixed.

If a developer dismisses a bug as "not important," how would you advocate for fixing it?
I would add it to trivial bugs, but I would address it after critical bugs are fixed and I would make a summary of the trivial bug to give a better understanding report to not dismiss it.

How can screenshots, logs, and screen recordings improve your bug reports?
They would provide a better understanding to approach the error, because the team responsible for fixing it would have a visual demonstration of the error.
