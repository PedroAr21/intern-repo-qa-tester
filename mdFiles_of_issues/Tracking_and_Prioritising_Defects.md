How would you prioritise a cosmetic UI issue vs. a login failure?
I would prioritise a cosmetic UI issue after solving the login failure, because costemic issues are minor affecting aesthetics. Fixing login failure first would ensure users can access the application.

If a developer says a bug is too minor to fix, how would you respond?
I would emphasized that we should at least address it afterwards and not overlook it.

How can testers ensure that low-priority bugs donâ€™t get forgotten?
Adding them in each bug report and testing them if they will not cause more complexity in the future.
